If you think you want to be a hacker it may be a good thing for you or maybe not. It is a simple code guessing / creating game or tool. it helps you to get a perfect guess for the code you don't know what it is. The goodness of this game everything is random, nothing is predefined.

## Concept

The core concept behind this as I mentioned earlier that it is a tool that makes your gassing easier. You can say yourself a so-called hacker. In this, you are tracking an unknown code and guess the correct code. Try it and give me feedback.

## How to Play

There is code with 3 digits. You have to guess the real code. First, you have to enter a digit 0-9 in all three boxes. Then try your code.
It will tall you two value 'H' or 'L'. 'H' refers for real code is higher than your digit and 'L' refers for relly code is lower than your code. then change them and try again. If you get a digit that means you are going in right direction. Its simple interface makes it pretty cool.
